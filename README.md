# nudoc - reproducible Nushell Markdown documents

Execute chunks of nushell code within markdown documents, output results to the terminal or write them back to your `.md` document.

nudoc is inspired by [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html#basics).

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/nushell101/nudoc; cd nudoc
use nudoc
nudoc run --quiet README.md
```

ðŸ—’ The code above isn't executed and updated by nudoc, as it lacks an opening ` ```nushell ` language idnetifier in the opening code fence tag.

## How it works

1. The `nudoc run` command opens a file from the first argument.
2. It looks for ` ```nushell ` code chunks.
3. In the code chunks, that entirely don't have lines starting with the `>` symbol, nudoc executes the whole code chunks as they are, and if they produce any output (like in `print 'this'`), then the output is written in the ` ```nudoc-output ` chunks, next to the executed code chunks.
4. In the code chunks that contain one or more lines starting with `>` symbol, nudoc filters only lines that start with the `>` or `#` symbol, executes those lines one by one and output their results just after the executed line.
5. nudoc outputs results code chunks and results of their execution into the terminal (if the `--quiet` flag is not used).
6. nudoc updates results in the file, which was provided as the first argument (user needs to confirm overwriting the file, if the `--overwrite` flag wasn't used).

```nushell
# Eventually, the script updates nushell code chunks.
